        mostly seen as a nuisance to them. But Laï was always so kind and
        adorable to him despite all of that. And so he always took care of her
        and stayed by her side no matter what.<br /><br />

        inseparable. He spent most of his time at Cléo's house since his parents
        didn't care about him but Cléo's parents did and they listened to him.

        and he 100% supported her and he helped her became the one that she is
        now.<br /><br />They got kicked out of their home not so long after and
